## Glossary

**Graph**
A graph is a visual representation of data. It's like a picture that shows how different pieces of information are 
related to each other. You can think of it like a map: just as a map helps you see where places are in relation to 
each other, a graph shows how different data points connect and how they are related to each other. Graphs are the 
products of data visualization. They can help you understand the data better by seeing trends and relations in it, 
introduce it to others and draw conclusions from it. 

**Data Visualization**
Data visualization is the broader practice of using graphs, charts, maps, and other visual tools to represent data. 
It’s all about turning raw data (numbers, facts, figures) into images that can communicate insights quickly and clearly. 
For example, instead of reading through pages of numbers, a well-designed chart can tell you the story behind those 
numbers, making it easier to understand patterns, trends, and relationships.

**Data Storytelling*:** 
Data storytelling is the art of combining data with a narrative. It's about presenting data not just as isolated 
facts, but in a way that tells a compelling story. It’s like writing a story, but instead of using words, you use data. 
The goal is to make the data more engaging and understandable for an audience by providing context, explaining trends, 
and helping people see the bigger picture. Good data storytelling helps people grasp what the data means and why it 
matters.

**Statistics** 
Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data. It involves methods for understanding and 
making sense of data, including calculating averages, percentages, trends, and variations. While data visualization 
and storytelling help communicate findings, statistics provides the tools to understand and measure the data itself. 
For example, if you want to know how typical or unusual a certain data point is, you would use statistical techniques 
to analyze it.
