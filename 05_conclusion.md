This lesson demonstrated how data visualization can teach the mathematical concepts behind machine learning and how 
it can be used not only to describe data but also to make preliminary predictions. While predictions based on 
visualization aren’t as precise as those derived through mathematical modeling, they can still support 
effective data storytelling.

In this lesson, you explored the concepts of statistical inference and regression through data 
visualization—two foundational processes in machine learning models. While we didn’t delve deeply into the 
mathematical details of these concepts, you learned their underlying logic and applied it by predicting the 
`happyScore` for two countries not included in the dataset. Additionally, you gained experience in visualizing 
scatter plots, bubble charts, and heatmaps using Python’s Seaborn library.

Understanding the difference between inferential and descriptive statistics, as introduced in this lesson, 
not only clarifies how machine learning models predict values but also strengthens your data storytelling skills. 
If you’ve primarily focused on describing existing data in your storytelling, you can now make approximate 
predictions for values not yet in your dataset based on the available data. 

### What's next?

Your next step could involve diving into the mathematical foundations of inferential statistics, including 
probability distributions, sampling methods, and the central limit theorem, to deepen your understanding of 
predictive models. You might also explore fundamental machine learning concepts, such as training and testing 
datasets and algorithms like linear regression and decision trees. Enhancing your Python data visualization 
skills and refining your approach to data storytelling by combining description and prediction could also be 
valuable next steps.
